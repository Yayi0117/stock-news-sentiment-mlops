# sns_mlops

This is a DTU MLOps course project focusing on engineering quality:
reproducible data pipelines, deterministic experiment artifacts, automated tests,
CI with coverage, and lightweight documentation.

## What this project does

- Task: sentiment classification of financial news text.
- Dataset: Hugging Face `NOSIBLE/financial-sentiment`.
- Model: `ProsusAI/finbert` fine-tuned using the Hugging Face Transformers `Trainer`.

## Key features

- Reproducible data build with schema validation and deterministic splits.
- Tiered datasets for different runtimes: `small` / `dev` / `full`.
- Reproducible training run artifacts: `run_config.json`, `metrics.json`, `train.log`.
- DVC pipeline stages: `data` and `train` (weights are saved locally but not tracked by DVC).
- CI: multi-OS + multi-Python tests, ruff linting/format checks, and coverage artifact upload.
- Docker: CPU-only training image in `dockerfiles/train.dockerfile`.

## Where to start

- See `Getting Started` for environment setup and a smoke run.
- See `Pipeline` for the data → train flow and output artifacts.
- See `API Reference` for autogenerated docs based on docstrings.
