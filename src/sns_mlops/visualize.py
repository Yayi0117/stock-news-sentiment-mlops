"""Visualization utilities (placeholder).

The cookiecutter template includes a visualization module, but this repository has
not yet implemented visualization outputs. If added later, visualizations should
be generated from deterministic artifacts (e.g., `metrics.json` or processed data)
and stored under `reports/figures/` for inclusion in `reports/README.md`.
